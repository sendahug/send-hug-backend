Previously, the databse URI was passed into the app as a string using an environment variable, which required manual escaping and didn't allow much flexibility. Now, the username, password, host, port and database name are passed in using a credentials file. The various parts are passed into SQLAlchemy's `URL` objects to generate a URL, which allows the SQLAlchemy engine to connect to the database."

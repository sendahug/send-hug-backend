      "description": "Added a new process for switching users from the `New User` role to the `User` role. When creating their account, users are given the `New User` role, which has limited capabilities. Once they verify their email address with Firebase and our system is updated, the `email_verified` flag is updated to True and their role is updated to be a regular user, with full capabilities. This ensures only real accounts can be used for interacting with the app."

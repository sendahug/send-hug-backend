      "description": "Changed the way the database is reset between tests. Previously, we created a database dump file that was restored between tests. This was over-complicated and unscalable. Now, we populate the database once, before tests start; in order to ensure the database returns to its original state between tests, tests are run within a nested session, which is then rolled back between tests."
